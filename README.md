# License_Plate_Recognition

To use the program you need a car detection model (.pb file).

You can use your own or use our model, you can download it from here:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hUVyvRdJgrQUeGqat3nMXVEL7IO4PKVk

(To use your own model change line 119 to "PATH_TO_CKPT = 'your_car_detection_model.pb' from plate_detection_video.py and plate_detection_single_image.py files")
